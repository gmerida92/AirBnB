Possible Extra Features Ideas
    Dynamic Search Bar
    Google Maps to show location of spots
    Dynamic Updating Average ratings
    Randomize and then reccomment location to book
    Group certain locations and user click button to return all locations in same category




All the users can have spots and all can do bookings so there are no difference between users
we dont need an extra column for host or regular user





images has a relationship to spots and reviews




/spots
/spots/search
/spots/filter



choose put or patch
put if modifying join table, in this case images table
patch for other tables becuase only updating certain pieces of data/attributes in the data

What is happening in the "Get all reviews of the current User"? Looks like reviews are an array of objecs thats that include users and spot, and images that has an array of objects
